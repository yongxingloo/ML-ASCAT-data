All outputs of the run has been kept (using the subset data). Therefore, it is possible to just read the .npy output files without re-running

If running is desired, then :
-> run.py for the desired file to run the preprocessing pipeline. 
-> this will generate all outputs and plots in the desired paths for the model.
